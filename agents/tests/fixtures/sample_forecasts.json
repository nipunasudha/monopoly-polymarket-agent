    "probability": 0.35,
    "confidence": 0.70,
    "base_rate": 0.30,
    "key_factors": [
      "Historical Bitcoin price volatility",
      "Current adoption trends",
      "Regulatory environment",
      "Institutional investment patterns"
    ],
    "evidence_for": [
      "Increasing institutional adoption",
      "Bitcoin ETF approvals in major markets",
      "Growing retail interest",
      "Limited supply dynamics"

      "Regulatory uncertainty in key markets",
      "Market volatility and corrections",
      "Competition from other cryptocurrencies",
      "Macroeconomic headwinds"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Based on historical trends and current market conditions, there is a moderate probability of Bitcoin reaching $100k by end of 2026. While institutional adoption continues to grow and supply remains limited, regulatory uncertainty and market volatility present significant risks. The base rate of 30% reflects historical price appreciation patterns, adjusted upward to 35% based on recent positive developments in the regulatory landscape."

    "probability": 0.28,

    "base_rate": 0.25,
    "key_factors": [
      "Ethereum network upgrades",

      "Successful transition to proof-of-stake",
      "Growing DeFi and NFT ecosystems",
      "Institutional interest in Ethereum",
      "Layer 2 scaling improvements"
    ],
    "evidence_against": [
      "Strong competition from Solana, Avalanche",
      "Gas fee concerns despite improvements",
      "Regulatory scrutiny of DeFi",
      "Market correlation with Bitcoin"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Ethereum has strong fundamentals with its proof-of-stake transition and growing ecosystem. However, reaching $10k represents a significant price increase that would require sustained market momentum and broader crypto adoption. Competition from other platforms and regulatory concerns temper the probability to 28%."

      "Elevated valuations",
      "Geopolitical tensions",
      "Potential recession risks",
      "Interest rate uncertainty"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The S&P 500 reaching 7000 by Q2 2026 is nearly a coin flip. Current valuations are elevated but not extreme, and corporate earnings remain strong. The key variables are Fed policy and economic growth. If the Fed successfully navigates a soft landing and earnings continue to grow, 7000 is achievable. However, recession risks and geopolitical uncertainties create significant downside risk."
